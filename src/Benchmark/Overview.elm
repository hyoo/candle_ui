                         Description of the Data

                         Data source: RNA-seq data from GDC
                         Input dimensions: 60,484 floats; log(1+x) transformed FPKM-UQ values
                         Output dimensions: Same as input
                         Latent representation dimension: 1000
                         Sample size: 4,000 (3000 training + 1000 test)
                         Notes on data balance and other issues: unlabeled data draw from a diverse set of cancer types
                         Expected Outcomes

                         Reconstructed expression profiles
                         Output range: float; same as log transformed input
                         Evaluation Metrics

                         Accuracy or loss function: mean squared error
                         Expected performance of a na√Øve method: landmark genes picked by linear regression
                         Description of the Network

                         Proposed network architecture: MLP with encoding layers, dropout layers, bottleneck layer, and decoding layers
                         Number of layers: At least three hidden layers including one encoding layer, one bottleneck layer, and one decoding layer
